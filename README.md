# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
## TollsIO - Toll Management System

### Project Overview
**TollsIO** is a comprehensive toll management information system designed to ensure interoperability between different toll operators across the country. The system processes toll passage data, calculates inter-operator debts, facilitates payment settlements, and provides analytical capabilities for stakeholders.

### System Architecture & Interfaces

#### External System Interfaces
- **Toll Operators**: Primary stakeholders providing toll passage data
- **Payment Service Providers**: External systems for financial transactions
- **Communication Protocol**: RESTful APIs with JSON data exchange
- **Security**: HTTPS with encrypted data transmission

#### User Interfaces
- **Command Line Interface (CLI)**: English-language interface for data input, search, and statistics
- **Web Application**: Graphical interface acting as REST API client
- **Security**: Self-signed certificates for secure data transmission

### Key Use Cases

#### Use Case 1: Debt and Revenue Management
**Description**: Display current debts and expected revenues for logged-in operators

**Actors**:
- Toll Operator
- Web Application System

**Preconditions**:
- Updated financial transactions in database
- Stable system operation without interruptions
- Secure internet connection

**Input Data**:
- Operator selection of "Debts Dashboard" or "Profits Dashboard"
- Operator Tag ID input
- Fetch action initiation

**Output**:
- Real-time debt obligations to other operators
- Future revenue projections
- Error messages for failed operations

**Performance Requirements**:
- Data loading: ≤ 1.5 seconds
- Display rendering: ≤ 2 seconds
- Payment processing: ≤ 1 second for bank request
- Payment confirmation: ≤ 2 seconds

#### Use Case 2: Toll Passage Statistics
**Description**: Display statistical data of toll station passages

**Actors**:
- Toll Operator
- Web Application System

**Preconditions**:
- Updated passage records in database
- Real-time statistical data availability
- Data quality control mechanisms

**Input Data**:
- "Statistics Dashboard" selection
- Operator Tag ID input
- "Fetch Statistics" action

**Output**:
- Passage frequency per operator
- Percentage distribution of passages
- Pie chart visualizations
- Tabular data presentation

**Performance Requirements**:
- Data loading: ≤ 1.5 seconds
- Display rendering: ≤ 2 seconds

### Data Management Requirements

#### Access Control
- Unique username and encrypted password authentication
- Role-based access to sensitive financial data
- Login table for user verification and access rights management

### Security Requirements

#### Data Privacy
- Least privilege access model
- Controlled interoperability between companies
- Detailed activity logging
